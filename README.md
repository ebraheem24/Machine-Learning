# Machine-Learning
 In this Respository, there are codes for multiple basic ML algorithms along with basic data cleansing.
 How to optimize the machine learning algorithms.
 How to choose which model is best for a particular problem.
 Comparing mulitple models performances on a similar dataset using different techniques.
 Also, there is code for how to split the dataset in train and test datasets. 
 How to save a model using two libraries i.e. Pickle and Joblib. 
 Feature Engineering by removing outliers using multiple techniques.
